   <h1>What is Karuta?<h1>
    <p>Karuta, also known as Ogurahyakuninissu, is a traditional Japanese card game. Now, hearing “card game”, you may think that Karuta is just a playful, relaxing game. But in fact, it is considered a sport and called “Tataminouenokakutougi”, meaning “combative sport on a tatami”. Players compete one on one, seriously in each game.</p>
